## PDF to Text Converter

This repository includes a simple script to extract text from a PDF file and
save it to a `.txt` document.

### Usage

Install the dependencies (PyPDF2) and run the script:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
python3 pdf_to_text.py input.pdf output.txt  # output file is optional
```

If `output.txt` is not provided, the text will be saved with the same name as the
PDF but with the `.txt` extension.
